title:Twice Baked Potatoes
ingredients:2 pounds Russet potatoes or large Yukon Gold potatoes; scrubbed and dried (about 4 potatoes)//
2 tablespoons vegetable oil or canola oil//
Salt and black pepper to taste//
4 ounces shredded cheese sharp cheddar, Gruyere, Mexican blend, or your favorite//
4 tablespoons unsalted butter room temperature and divided//
2-4 scallions thinly sliced and divided//
4 strips bacon cut into ¼-inch lardons, cooked until crisp, and divided//
3/4 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt//
3/4 cup buttermilk//
Minced fresh herbs parsley, thyme, cilantro, chives; for garnish
instructions:Preheat oven to 400°F and adjust the oven rack to the middle position.//
Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet.//
Lightly rub each potato with oil and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper.//
Place the potatoes, evenly spaced, on the rack over the prepared baking sheet.//
Bake the potatoes to an internal temperature of 209F or until fork tender (45 minutes-1 hour).//
Remove the potatoes from the oven, and leave the oven on.//
Once the potatoes have cooled on the rack 10 minutes, cut the potatoes in half lengthwise.//
Leave a 1/8-1/4-inch thickness of flesh in each shell.//
Carefully scoop out the potato flesh into a medium-large mixing bowl.//
Transfer the potato shells back to the prepared baking sheet and bake at 400F for 10 minutes.//
While the shells cook, mash together half of the cheese, butter, scallions, and lardons with all of the sour cream, buttermilk, and baked potato flesh until smooth.//
Season with salt and pepper and mix together.//
Transfer shells from the oven and set the oven to broil.//
Fill the potato shells, mounding in the middle, with the mashed potato mixture and top with remaining cheese, scallions, bacon lardons, and butter.//
Broil until the cheese has melted and the potatoes are spotty brown and little crispy on top, approximately 5-10 minutes.//
Watch closely.//
Allow the potatoes to cool 10 minutes and serve topped with minced herbs, if desired.//
